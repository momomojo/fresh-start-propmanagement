## Priority Order

1. Architecture
   - Must be addressed first as it affects all other solutions
   - Defines core patterns and flows
   - Establishes boundaries between systems

2. Security
   - Builds on architectural decisions
   - Critical for proper authentication flow
   - Must be aligned with architectural patterns

3. Implementation
   - Depends on both architecture and security decisions
   - Implements the defined patterns
   - Handles specific use cases

4. Organization
   - Can be addressed after core functionality is working
   - Improves maintainability
   - Makes the codebase more scalable
